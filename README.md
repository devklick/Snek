# Snek
This is a console-based version of the classic mobile game, Snake.

Using the arrow keys on your keyboard, control the Snek and try to eat all the yummy blue blocks. Every time a block is eaten, the Snek grows in size and speeds up.

It was created and Forgotten about a long time ago, so it's a little rough around the edges and could do with some polishing.
